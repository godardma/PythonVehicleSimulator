## Install:
To run the main program ```main.py``` the following modules must be installed:

    numpy           https://numpy.org/install/
    matplotlib      https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html
    pytest          https://docs.pytest.org

The Python packages are automatically installed by using the command

```pip install <path>```

where ```<path>``` is the path of the downloaded PythonVehicleSimulator repository. Example:

1. Click on the green code tab on GitHub and choose download
2. This gives you the catalog: PythonVehicleSimulator (can be renamed)
3. ```python3 -m pip install -e /MY_PATH/PythonVehicleSimulator```

Note that the -e option is needed to update and change the files. If omitted, you can only run the program.
